## Concepts Learned

-   **User Input & Type Conversion:** Capturing user input and converting it from a string to an integer with `int(input())`.
-   **Looping:** Using a `while` loop to continue the game until the correct number is guessed.
-   **Random Number Generation:** Using `random.randint()` to create the secret number.
-   **Conditional Logic:** Implementing the "higher/lower" hints with `if/elif/else` statements.
